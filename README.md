# Getting an ILD repository

If you are part of the ILD collaboration and doing physics analysis, this the place to end up. You can contact us by email in order to get a public repository in the ILDAnaSoft collaboration and we will create it for you.

In order to be efficient, we would need the following information in the email:

- Your name and surname
- Your github user name
- A short description of the repository to create (15 words)
- The name of the repository you want

If you are working on an [ILD physics benchmark](https://confluence.desy.de/display/ILD/Benchmarks+for+physics-driven+detector+optimisation), please provide a short name. For example, for the benchmark "*Hadronic branching ratios of the Higgs: H-->bb/cc/gg*", the name "*Hbbccgg*" would be ideal. Note that for the case of benchmark analysis repositories, the name "ILDBench_" will prepended in the repository name (e.g *ILDBench_Hbbccgg*). 

# ILD root style

Please use the ILDStyle defined in this [rootlogon.C](https://confluence.desy.de/download/attachments/86672293/rootlogon.C) macro for your ILD plots.
In addition, write "ILD" or "ILD preliminary" on your plots as appropriate.

## First Steps

If you are new to iLCSoft you can follow this [tutorial](./tutorial/gaede_ilcsoft_tutorial.pdf)
to familiarize yourself with the basic software and analysis tools.


If you are new to git and Github you *should* follow this [tutorial](https://github.com/andresailer/tutorial).

For a short version of how to configure git correctly see below.

### how to download, change and upload files/repositories (ILDDoc.git in this example)
	
- clone ILDDoc.git

		git clone https://github.com/ILDAnaSoft/ILDDoc.git
		cd ILDDoc
	
- create a fork of the repository on the Github web page
  - if you have not yet done so earlier

- add your fork as remote downstream using your GitHub username

		git remote add downstream  https://<yourUserName>@github.com/<yourUserName>/ILDDoc.git
	
- create a new feature branch; choose a meaningful name

		git checkout -b <myNewBranch>
	
- open the file you want to change and execute your changes (e.g.: edit <filename> &)
	
- check the the changed version

		git diff

- commit your changes to local repository; write a commit message in editor window; close the window

		git ci -a

- upload file back to your github account

		git push downstream	<myNewBranch>

- reload your own github website (https://github.com/<yourUserName>/ILDDoc)
  - you should see your commit
  - trigger a pull request on the web site


- bring your local repository in sync with the *origin*
- **after** the pull request has been accepted
	
		git checkout master
		git pull origin

- optionally you can also update the master on your fork 

		git push downstream master


#### some useful git commands

Use the following git commands to investigate the status of your local git repository:

	git lola

Displays the current HEAD and all known branches of your local repository and all known remotes. For example
if everything went fine after you committed some changes, you should see sth like 

	* b6f0c82 (HEAD, refs/heads/<myNewBranch>) <your commit message> 

You can always check the current status (in particular the current branch with:

	git stat

This also displays locally modified and staged files.


To display in detail the log messages of recent commits do:

	git logf

Refer to more exhaustive git documentation for more involved tasks. 



### configuration of git

- open a terminal and log in
- open `.gitconfig` with an editor 
- check your data and adapt them to the example below:
	
		[user]
			name = <you name>
			email = <your email> 
		[alias]
			what = whatchanged
			stat = status
			ci = commit
			co = checkout
			lola = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all
			logf = "!echo \"Remember to add -S<string>\" ; git log --color -p --source --all"
			logrl = log --pretty=format:\"%aN %ad %n  - %s\" --date=short
		[color]
			ui = true
			diff = auto
			status = auto
		[core]
			excludesfile = <YourHomeFolde>/.gitignore_global
			editor = gedit
		[branch]
			autosetuprebase = always
		[push]
			## for newer versions of git, otherwise try "simple"
			default = matching
		
- save your changes
	
	
	

## The events samples in ILD group
In ILD group, many SM and new physics event samples have already been generated and simulated.
The detail information of the SM event samples can be found at 
http://ilcsoft.desy.de/dbd/generated/

There are two kinds of data file, DST and REC file. The "REC" file contains all infomation for generating, simulation and reconstruction.
The "DST" file only contain some of them. Usually, the "DST" file is suitable for analysis, but you can also check the "REC" file for more details.
The sample file name in the ILD group will look like

`rv01-19-04_lcgeo.sv01-19-04_lcgeo.mILD_l4_v02.E250-TDR_ws.I106479.Pe2e2h.eL.pR.n001_012.d_rec_00008603_6.slcio`

|short name | meaning  | example | explanation |
|:---------:|:--------:|:-------:|:------------:|
|rv | reconstruction software version|  01-19-04_lcgeo |                                                    |
|sv | simulation     software version|  01-19-04_lcgeo |                                                    |
|m  | ILD detector   software version|  ILD_l4_v02     |  ILD detector version                              | 
|E  | collider energy                |  250-TDR_ws     |  250 GeV collider                                  |
|I  | Proc ID                        |  106479         |  each process has a unique id                      |   
|P  | process name                   |  e2e2h          |  ee -> zh then z-> mu mu process                   | 
|e  | beam polorization              |  eL             |  electron is left-handed                           | 
|p  | beam polorization              |  pR             |  positron is right-handed                          | 
|n  | job number                     |  001_012        |  the number for simulation group submitting the job|
|d  | Job ID                         |  rec_00008603_6 |  this is a REC file                                |

In principle, one can re-generate all the same events with the same software setting.


## ILD format
Below are the generally structure of a DST/REC slcio file.

The DST files used for ILD are described at [./dst/ild_dst_collections.md](./dst/ild_dst_collections.md).

The REC files used for ILD are described at [./rec/ild_rec_collections.md](./rec/ild_rec_collections.md).




## How to run Marlin for analysis
You can learn how to write a Marlin steering file from iLCSoft Documents at [https://github.com/iLCSoft/ilcsoftDoc/blob/master/README_Introduction_For_iLCSoft.md](https://github.com/iLCSoft/ilcsoftDoc/blob/master/README_Introduction_For_iLCSoft.md)

In this section, we will introduce some common Marlin processors for physics analysis.

### Processors for reconstructed 
There is a brief summary for [processors for reconstructing particles in ILD Analysis](./processors/summary_ILD_processors_for_reconstruction.md).

### Processors for analysis
There is a brief summary for [processors for further analysis in ILD Analysis](./processors/summary_ILD_processors_for_analysis.md).

### How to create a ROOT file with LCTuple
LCTuple processor is a common-used processor to change the slcio file into a root file. This can be done by the command:
`Marlin lctuple.xml --global.GearXMLFile=gear_ILD_l4_v02_dd4hep.xml `

this creates a file <...>_REC_lctuple.root which can be analyzed. The lctuple.xml file can be found in LCTuple/examples/ folder

In the new root file, all the particle information is reserved, but lcio data struction information is removed. 
It means that you can only rely on root programming knowledge, and don't need to know anything about lcio API. 

For more information about LCTuple, see 
[https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCTuple](https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCTuple)



## How to program for analysis
Some general information about how to write a Marlin processor is at [https://github.com/iLCSoft/ilcsoftDoc/blob/master/README_Introduction_For_iLCSoft.md](https://github.com/iLCSoft/ilcsoftDoc/blob/master/README_Introduction_For_iLCSoft.md)

Here, we will show some examples of processor programming for analysis. With these basic commands, you can begin to program your own processor for analysis. 
The further usages of lcio can be found at [http://lcio.desy.de/v02-09/doc/](http://lcio.desy.de/v02-09/doc/)

The most common used collections are MCParticle, PandoraPFOs, MCTruthRecoLink and RecoMCTruthLink.
You can load MCParticle collection in your processor by  

```
registerInputCollection( LCIO::MCPARTICLE,
		"MCParticleCollection", 
		"Name of the MC particle collection",
		_colMC,
		std::string("MCParticle") );
```
And with the similar command you can load PandoraPFOs, MCTruthRecoLink RecoMCTruthLink collections. 
We suppose the name for MCParticle, PandoraPFOs and RecoMCTruthLink collections are _colMC, _colPFO, _mcpfoRelation and _pfomcRelation.
Now after you load them, they are only strings, to get the real collections, you should use command as
```
LCCollection* AllMC= evt->getCollection( _colMC) ;
```
where "evt" is the pointer of the event.

To get the pointer of one specific MCParticle, you can use
```
	int nMC = AllMC->getNumberOfElements();
	MCParticle* MC = dynamic_cast< MCParticle* >( AllMC->getElementAt(i) );
```
In the first line, "nMC" tells you how many MCParticles for this event,
where i in the second line is an integer, which begin from 0 and should smaller than "nMC"


   For MCParticle, the detail information in slcio file is

  | name |[id]| index | PDG    | px, py, pz  | px_ep, py_ep, pz_ep   | energy    | gen                | [simstat] | vertex x, y, z | endpoint x, y, z | mass | charge | spin | colorflow | [parents] - [daughters]|
  |------|----|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|------|--------|------|-----------|------------------------|
  |method|    |       |getPDG()|getMomentum()|getMomentumAtEndpoint()|getEnergy()|getGeneratorStatus()|getSimulatorStatus()|getVertex()|getEndpoint()|getMass()|getCharge()|getSpin()|getColorFlow()|getParents(),getDaughters()|
   
   In the above table, the first row is the variable name, and the second row is the corresponding methed to invoke them in the processor. 
For example, once you declare a new MCParticle, you can use the command like `MC->getPDG()` to get the PDG information of that MCParticle.

   For PandoraPFOs, the information is similar, and with some information about tracks, vertices and clusters.

   |[id]| com | type | momentum | energy | mass | charge | position ( x,y,z ) | pidUsed | GoodnessOfPID | covariance( px,py,pz,E ) | particles([id]) | tracks ([id]) | clusters ([id]) | particle ids ([id],PDG,(type)) | vertices|
   |----|-----|------|----------|--------|------|--------|--------------------|---------|---------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|---------|

   The method for invoke these variables can be found at [http://lcio.desy.de/v02-09/doc/doxygen_api/html/classEVENT_1_1ReconstructedParticle.html](http://lcio.desy.de/v02-09/doc/doxygen_api/html/classEVENT_1_1ReconstructedParticle.html), where you can also find other c++ API for lcio.

The MCTruthRecoLink reflects that if you have know a MCParticle, then what reconstructed particles it can be. You can load this information by a LCRelationNavigator.
For example 

```
LCRelationNavigator* relation_mcpfo= new LCRelationNavigator( evt->getCollection( _mcpfoRelation ) );
```

Then use

```
LCObjectVec fromMCobj = relation_mc->getRelatedToObjects(MC[i]);
// fromMC may contain many reconstructed particles, they all come from this MC[i]
// a dynamic_cast should be used to turn them to ReconstructedParticle. 

std::vector<ReconstructedParticle*> fromMC;
for( unsigned int j = 0; j < frompars.size(); j++ ){
	ReconstructedParticle* recpfo = dynamic_cast< ReconstructedParticle* >( fromMC_obj[j] );
	fromMC.push_back(recpfo);
}
```
Now the vector "fromMC" contains all ReconstructedParticles that come from  MC[i].

The RecoMCTruthLink is opposite to MCTruthRecoLink, which tells you that for one reconstructed particle, it comes from how many MCParticles.
